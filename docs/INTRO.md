## Apps (aka Applications)

Making an app on Discord opens up many possibilities for deeper integrations with your other services and platforms.
Here are some examples to whet your appetite:

* Using your Discord account to login to your guild's website safely
* Pulling up who's online or in-game from Discord on your website or forum
* Automatically join private Discord servers or gain new roles based on external website permissions
* Other neat things

Want your guild's forum to use the same login as your guild's Discord account safely? That's what our new
[applications](/developers/applications/me) feature is for!
